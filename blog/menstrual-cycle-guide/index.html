    <h1>Understanding Your Menstrual Cycle</h1>
    <p class="muted">Published on Oct 12, 2025 Â· 8 min</p>

    <p>Your menstrual cycle is a living rhythmâ€”one that influences your energy, your emotions, and your intimate
        connection with yourself or your partner. Tracking it should give you clarity, not pressure. With Intimory you
        simply log period days and keep an eye on the estimated ovulation day, all while keeping every detail under your
        control.</p>

    <h2>The four phases at a glance</h2>
    <p>Every cycle is unique, yet the same four phases offer a simple map:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Menstruation:</strong> the start of the cycle and a time to rest and slow down.</li>
        <li><strong>Follicular phase:</strong> hormones rise, energy returns, and creativity often sparks.</li>
        <li><strong>Ovulation:</strong> the fertile window, usually marked by a noticeable boost in mood and connection.</li>
        <li><strong>Luteal phase:</strong> a gradual winding down; tracking symptoms here helps anticipate PMS.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Even with a lightweight tool, noting where you are in the cycle lets you compare months at a glance and notice how
        habits or lifestyle changes affect how you feel.</p>

    <h2>Spotting meaningful patterns</h2>
    <p>Numbers alone never tell the full story. Pair the cycle overview in Intimory with a personal journal or the Health
        app on your iPhone if you want to add more contextâ€”mood, cramps, libido, energy. Over a handful of cycles you
        might observe trends such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Recurring headaches a few days before menstruation.</li>
        <li>Peak intimacy or date nights around ovulation.</li>
        <li>Better sleep when you prepare nutrient-dense meals during the luteal phase.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These insights make it easier to plan self-care or conversations with your partner and health professionals.</p>

    <h2>Log the essentials</h2>
    <p>Intimory keeps tracking simple. Mark the days of your period and check the highlighted ovulation window calculated
        from your recent cycles. If you want to keep richer notes, you can complement the app with a notebook or another
        private tool while still relying on Intimory for the core timing.</p>

    <h2>When to share your data (and when not to)</h2>
    <p>Only you decide who sees your cycle information. Intimory does not create profiles or export anything unless you
        choose to. You can open the calendar during a medical appointment or a couple conversation, then keep the rest
        private. That balance builds trust and keeps the conversation focused on what matters.</p>

    <h2>Supporting overall well-being</h2>
    <p>Menstrual health is connected to mental health, rest, nutrition, and intimacy. Having a clear view of your rhythm
        helps you spot early signs of imbalance, prepare for demanding weeks, or celebrate small wins like pain-free
        periods. The more you log, the easier it becomes to align activities, intimacy, and recovery with your bodyâ€™s
        timing.</p>

    <h2>Start observing today</h2>
    <p>Whether you are new to cycle tracking or ready to replace another app, Intimory keeps things simple and private.
        Your cycle becomes a guide you can rely onâ€”no ads, no hidden agenda, only information you fully control.</p>
